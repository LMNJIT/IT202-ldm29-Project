            <p>Our store was founded by a group of friends who found it was increasingly difficult to acquire 
                good, affordable tech and tech accessories. Stores were marking up prices and treating 
                customers like they knew nothing about the products! The shopping environment these 
                companies fosterd was becoming increasingly hostile to the average consumer. Luka's Tech 
                Shop is dedicated to doing the exact opposite of this; our mission statement is to give 
                our customers excellent tech products and tech accessories while treating them with the 
                respect they deserve.</p>
